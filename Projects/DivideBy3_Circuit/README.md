# Divide By 3 VHDL Circuit

This VHDL project generates a 50% duty cycle waveform for a system clock that is divided by 3.  The waveform can be verified running the simulation testbench file in Vivado.  The project also includes a top level file that interfaces with an FPGA board.  The top level file generates a slow clock that maps to LED(1) on the FPGA, while the output of the divideBy3 hardware maps to LED(0).
