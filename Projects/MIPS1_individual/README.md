# Computer Architecture
## MIPS 1 - Processor Building Blocks - The Arithmetic Logic Unit

### MIPS 1 Overview
For this laboratory you will complete MIPS_1-1, MIPS_1-2, and MIPS_1-3 individually. You will then collaborate on MIPS_1-4 as a group to design a custom Arithmetic Logic Unit in VHDL.

The MIPS_1-1 through MIPS_1-3 subprojects are all located in this folder. You will however have a shared repository for MIPS_1-4 that will be located in the group projects area.


### Grade Break Down
| Part                             |   | Points  |
|----------------------------------|---|---------|
| MIPS_1-1 - Generic Adder Example |   | 10 pts  |    
| MIPS_1-2 - Textbook ALU          |   | 20 pts  |   
| MIPS_1-3 - Wikipedia ALU         |   | 20 pts  |   
| Total                            |   | 50 pts  |

NOTE: MIPS_1-4 will be graded separately and will be worth 50 points as well. 


### Completing MIPS_1-1 to MIPS_1-3
Each of the MIPS_1_x folders has a Readme.md file in it. You will follow the instructions in those files, put your answers directly into the Readme.md and push your answers back to your whitgit repository.
